<h2> Programming Is Art <br/>
<span> Poem by Tea Kawana </span>
</h2>
<p> As if he were a painter, <br>
he interpreted his thoughts using colour,<br>
with his tools:<br>
several brushes and a paint palette.<br>
As if he played in some orchestra or band,<br>
and the notes from the sheet music were <br>
expressed through the very contact of his <br>
instrument and himself; <br>
and the translation of the incomprehensible <br>
beautiful marks on the sheet, <br>
to a set theme, one could envision in the mind,<br>
was impeccably evident through play.<br>
As if he were a dancer,<br>
having polished up all the various essential techniquesâ€¦<br>
and how the flexibility and movement of his body <br>
extract the notation to beautiful action. <br>
Through his own specialty,<br>
I see all these come into play,<br>
I see art. </p>
